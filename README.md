Abstract

Airsoft is a popular and growing hobby with new people playing trying the hobby every year,
however Airsoft is a complex game, with each site having its own sets of rules and games and as a result issues arise from players not fully knowing the rules and site layouts,
leading to rule breaking and potential injury.

The Goal of this application is to help both newer players and experienced ones better understand the rules of each site and the games played there,
as well as help staff enforce rules and maintain safety for players.

The way this app intends to do this is by making sure that all the information that players need for each game is available at all times during the game,
by adding in a tracking feature that allows players to see where each other are for gameplay and for staff to see where all players are on the site,
to help rule enforcement by using geofencing technology.

Quartermaster is going to be a Mobile application that is designed for Airsoft players and Airsoft Marshals,
its purpose is to give airsoft players more information so they can play the game better with less confusion over rules,
and to help marshals make sure that players remain safe throughout the game day.
